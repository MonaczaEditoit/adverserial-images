# Adverserial Images
This project contains classification of MNIST images using Convolution Neural Network.
Then visualizing each layer and its internal working. Then generating speicfic noises which model classifies as a number(class).
The we do a targetted attack on the Trained model using adverserial images. Generating images which gives wrong prediction with high confidence.
